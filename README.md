# drf-react

drf-react is a project created to learn how to build applications using Django REST Framework and React.

drf-react uses [Django REST Framework ](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to construct an API and [django-cors-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) to add Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to responses in order to allow React to make requests.
